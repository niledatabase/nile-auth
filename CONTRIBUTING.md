# Contributing to Nile-Auth

Welcome to Nile-Auth. We are glad you are interested in contributing to this project. We welcome contributions of all kinds, including bug reports, feature requests, code improvements, and documentation updates.

## Packages and Tech Stack

- `@nile-auth/server`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app for serving REST APIs
- `@nile-auth/query`: a small wrapper around [pg node](https://node-postgres.com/) to make querying easier
- `@nile-auth/core`: a small wrapper around NextAuth(https://next-auth.js.org/) which connects to a Nile database

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

We use [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) (please avoid `npm`) and [`Turborepo`](https://turbo.build/) for managing dependencies and builds.
